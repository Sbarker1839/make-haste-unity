# make-haste-unity
Unity Team project

This project was the final project for the Class EECS 290: Introduction to Computer Game Design and Implementation.

I worked alongside three other classmates in order to create a fully functional game in Unity.  We worked together as a team over several weeks to create an original game from scratch.
